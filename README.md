# Benchmarks
This repository contains examples of multi-modal deep neural networks that we use for other projects. We use these networks as real world examples that support DOE science.


The examples directory may contain non multi-modal deep neural networks that are of some interest.


Some of the infrastructure comes from the ECP-CANDLE project.
